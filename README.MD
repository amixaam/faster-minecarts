# faster-minecarts
an extremely simple behavior pack to roughly double the speed of minecarts for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition version 1.21.130 and up (perchance).

## usage
If you want to use this behavior pack, just download the .mcpack file and put it in your behavior packs folder.

## modification
if you want to change the minecart speed to a different value, just change the `"max_speed"` property to whatever you want.

`max_speed` is calculated by `max_speed x tick_speed`, so a value of `0.7` would be around `14m/s`.

once modified, select all files and zip them. once zipped, rename the .zip extension to .mcpack
